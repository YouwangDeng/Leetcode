# Leetcode Note
Note about data structure, problem solutions and mistakes during coding
### Two Sum
* the brutal force solution takes O(n^2) time
* define HashMap: Map \<type 1, type 2> map  = new HashMap<>();
* map.containsKey(k) is a O(1) weapon
* do manipulation while constructing the map
* use HashMap to reduce TP
* do not forget return statement in the end of the code

### Add Two Numbers
* ListNode use dummy to begin
* Do not spell wrong variable name
* Combine same code to a code block make code be more concise
* use carry to do digit manipulation
