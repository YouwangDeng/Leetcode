* A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* JavaScript tutorial

* An important difference between JavaScript and other languages like Java is that in JavaScript, blocks do not have scope; only functions have a scope. So if a variable is defined using var in a compound statement (for example inside an if control structure), it will be visible to the entire function. However, starting with ECMAScript 2015, let and const declarations allow you to create block-scoped variables.
* JavaScript objects can be thought of as simple collections of name-value pairs. As such, they are similar to:
    * Dictionaries in Python.
    * Hashes in Perl and Ruby.
    * Hash tables in C and C++.
    * HashMaps in Java.
    * Associative arrays in PHP.
* Note that array.length isn't necessarily the number of items in the array.
* ES2015 introduced the more concise for...of loop for iterable objects such as arrays:
* for (const currentValue of a) {
  // Do something with currentValue
}
* You could also iterate over an array using a for...in loop, however this does not iterate over the array elements, but the array indices. 
* Another way of iterating over an array that was added with ECMAScript 5 is forEach():
* ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'].forEach(function(currentValue, index, array) {
  // Do something with currentValue or array[index]
});
* If you want to append an item to an array simply do it like this: a.push(item);
* JavaScript lets you call a function with an arbitrary array of arguments, using the apply() method of any function object: avg.apply(null, [2, 3, 4, 5]); // 3.5
* The first argument to apply() is the object that should be treated as 'this'.
* The second argument to apply() is the array to use as arguments; the first will be discussed later on. This emphasizes the fact that functions are objects too
* apply() has a sister function named call, which again lets you set this but takes an expanded argument list as opposed to an array.

    ```
    function lastNameCaps() {
      return this.last.toUpperCase();
    }
    var s = new Person('Simon', 'Willison');
    lastNameCaps.call(s);
    // Is the same as:
    s.lastNameCaps = lastNameCaps;
    s.lastNameCaps(); // WILLISON
    ```
* React quick tutorial
    * https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/
* React is not a framework (unlike Angular, which is more opinionated).
* React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end.
* React is the view layer of an MVC application (Model View Controller)
