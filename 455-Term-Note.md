# 455 Mid Term 1
* draw box make process clear
* (i + k) % arr.length to move elements left k posotions
* String length() and Array length
* Programmers who use the Time class don't have to do anything, because the interface doesn't change.
* partially filled array may have element with 0 value, should not use value to determine a end of partially filled array
* use the method of ImPoint in the code
* store continuous int values in an array during implementation
* initialize an object array, do not forget to **new** each element in the array 
* be carful about int or double types, no always int
* the valid range for startLoc is [0, namesArr.length]
* `locOfTarget == NOT_FOUND` use the constant name instead of the value
* copy java files use *.java

* while Hash Table insert an element, it has first to find if there is already a one in the LinkedList, search costs time
* Hash Size should be a prime, since we have to use modulus on the size, such as hash code % size
* for hashCode contract, if a.equals(b), then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode(), the converse contract is not true, if a and b have the same hashCode, it does not mean that a equals b.
* Set<Integer> uniqueValues = new HashSet<Integer>();
* LinkedList<Integer> result = new LinkedList();
* ListIterator<Integer> iter1 = list1.listIterator();
* use the interface on the exam code handout
