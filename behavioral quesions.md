# Behavioral Quesions
* Tell me about your self
    * try a concise, enthusiastic response that summarizes your big-picture fit for the job
    * A good interview is a dialogue, not a monologue. Keep it concise and give your interviewer the chance to dive in and ask questions.
    * A great answer will address the following:
        * What are your primary selling points for this job? This could be number of years of experience in a particular industry or area of specialization. You might also highlight special training and technical skills here. Focus on the qualifications in the job description and how you meet and exceed the requirements.
        * Why are you interested in this position right now? You can wrap up your answer by indicating why you are looking for a new challenge and why you feel this role is the best next step.
    * Formula
        * Who You Are
            * Concisely summarizes diverse background.
            * Good: “I’m an innovative HR manager with 8 years of experience managing all aspects of the HR function — from recruiting to training to benefits — for Fortune 500 companies.”
        * Expertise Highlights 
            * Use your elevator pitch to briefly highlight 2-4 points that you think make you stand out.
            * The emphasis here is on experience, enthusiasm, and proof of performance.
            * Good: “I have spent the last six years developing my skills as a customer service manager for Megacompany Inc., where I have won several performance awards and been promoted twice. I love managing teams and solving customer problems.”
        * Why You’re Here
            * Concise and positive.
            * Don’t be too candid or you risk coming across as negative. This answer also makes it seem like you’re interested in a job, any job — not this job in particular.
            * Good: “Although I love my current role, I feel I’m now ready for a more challenging assignment and this position really excites me.”
            * I'm a person who thrives in a fast-paced environment, so right now I'm looking for an opportunity to apply my technology expertise, along with my creative problem solving skills at an innovative software company.
* what's your greatest weakness?
    * should be sincere
    * should not be crucial to the job
    * offer your solution to this weakness and your progress
* The biggest mistake you made and what you learn from it?
* Have you worked with someone you did not like and is difficult to get along with?
    * working with the person I did not like is stressing, so I decide to work toward this issue. I aimed at understanding the person and knowing what made him behave this way. You did this through engaging a project that involved working with the colleague and by the end of it, I managed to understand the person and worked towards building a positive relationship.
    * May also mention that one might be wrong, but we should work towards building on strengths rather than concentrating on weaknesses.
* Have you worked with a coworker who was not shouldering fair share of work?
    *
