# 570 Term 1
* master method use the equal bound sign
* pseudocode in DP 
* each subproblem requires finding an index f(k) which can be done in time O(log n) by binary search.

## 570 Term 2
* DP problem
    * you must open at least one charging station along the whole highway.
    * Base cases: OPT(0) = 0, OPT(1) = p1
    * Algorithm solves n subproblems; each subproblem requires finding an index f(k) which can be done in time O(log n) by binary search. Hence, the running time i
* Max Flow
    * max flow problem also need proof
